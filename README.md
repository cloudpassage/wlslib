#wlslib - Halo Utility Library

Version: *1.0*
<br />
Author: *William Stearns* - *wstearns@cloudpassage.com*

This is a library of useful routines that make calls to the CloudPassage API. Your Ruby scripts can call these routines to perform basic Halo operations.

If you have questions about this library, please contact the author.

####Note:
Some older tools which require this library look for a file in the local directory or in your PATH named wlslib.rb.  You can still place that file as directed, it's located at lib/wslib.rb.  Building this as a gem is confirmed to work on Ruby 2.2.0 and under most circimstances you can change the line that looks like this:
'''
load 'wlslib.rb'
'''
to:
'''
require 'wlslib'
'''
to get the tool to work with the gem loaded.

##Requirements and Dependencies

To run, this script requires:

* Ruby installed on the host on which the script runs
* A number of Ruby gems. Use the following command to install all gems needed by CloudPasssage API clients:

    sudo gem install oauth2 rest-client json public_suffix ip


##List of Files

* **wlslib.rb**  -  The library
* **README.md**  -  This ReadMe file


##Installation 

Place this library in the same directory as the programs that will be calling it. For example, /usr/local/bin/ or ~/bin/. 


##Usage

The library includes the following functions:

* **api_live**: Verifies that API calls can be made successfully -- that Internet connectivity exists, that the local firewall allows outbound requests, and that the supplied API key values are valid.

* **get_group_names**: Returns the name and group ID for all defined server groups. 

* **api_delete**: Deletes an API object specified by URL.

* **api_get**: Performs an HTTPS GET call to return (as JSON) the content of an API object specified by URL.

* **api_put**: Performs an HTTPS PUT call to modify the content of an API object specified by URL, replacing it with the supplied JSON.

* **api_post**: Performs an HTTPS POST call to modify the content of an API object specified by URL, replacing it with the supplied payload object.

* **cached_api_get**: Places API get calls, and for calls to get events, caches the results in ~/api_cache.  If the same request for events is placed twice, the response json is pulled from the local cache, significantly improving event-retrieval performance.

* **get_parent_domain**: returns the name of the domain that a specified IP address belongs to.

* **cleanup_parent_domain**: Allows you to specify substitutions for specific domain names. 

* **load_api_keys**: Reads all API keys from a Halo API key file, usually /etc/halo-api-keys.

* **get_auth_token**: Authenticates to the API and retrieves an access token.

* **id_of_server**: Returns the server ID for a server specified by name or IP address

* **process_return_code**: Provides error messages to display to the caller when an API call fails.

* **append_to_file**: Appends the specified API object as JSON to the specified file, creating the file if necessary.
